# wiggleman
A program to generate procedural sprite-sheets for 2d animations.

Wiggleman utilises Qt and basic drawing functionality to create sprite sheets of varying lengths and sizes.
Allows easy customisation for game characters (assuming this style) without hand-animating every character.

## Examples
There are example animations and body definitions found in */examples* which can be imported into the app.
You can also export your own definitions for editing later.

There are also some example outputs.
